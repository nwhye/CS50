# --- CLASSES AND OBJECTS
# class - blueprint, allows us to create our own data type (to define custom containers for pieces of data)
# primary feature of OOP is to be able to create your own objects

# when you use class you create OBJECTS (or instance)
# .name and .house here are attributes

# however it's reckless to put anything you want inside of object
# here the example with more control, as we're passing specific thing in to the class


def get_student():
    name = input("Enter your name: ")
    house = input("Enter your house: ")
    student = Student(name, house)  # working as a constructor
    return student

# --- CLASS (INSTANCE) METHODS

# let's fix things in class
# they come with certain METHODS

# object is an instance of the class

# self - represents the instance of the class being used
# instance - variable belonging to one and only one object


class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, house):  # dander init method - instance method, to initialize contents of the objects and
        # objects itself
        #                   ^ adding variables to objects
        # self is like the access to the current object that was created, place where variables stored
        self.name = name  # instance variable, can be .n .h, but it's less readable
        self.house = house  # there can be stored list, and not only variable


# we make variables inside the object and assign inside

# --- RAISE
# to create and raise your own exception when something goes wrong
# to alert that there is an error

# now we can control what's going inside the class. While in dictionary we can put anything

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, house):

# --- PROPERTIES
# attribute with more defence mechanism, to prevent programmers to mess things up
# @property is to decorate functions
# decorators - functions that modify the behaviour of other functions

# property (fancy attribute(function)) called "house" and instance variable "_house"
# so when we return variable we print "return self.house"

# GETTER - function for a class to that gets some attribute
# @property to treat it as a getter
    @property
    def house(self):
        return self._house  # _house - instance variable

# SETTER - function in a class that sets some value
# now what to do to prevent setting invalid value
# called when trying to = to the object (student.house = "pepepoopoo") and anything ".house"
# so it is checking and not allowing, and raising ValueError
# @house.setter to treat it as a setter

# so no blind assignment from left to right, and if you try, it is checking class for setter

# !!! if you have instance variables "house" you can't call function "house"
    @house.setter

# _ means (by convention) private and "please, don't touch it"

# int str are classes, and .lower, .strip - methods that pre-build in the class

# dict() and {} are the same
# list() and [] are the same

# --- CLASS METHODS

# to create action that associated with the class, no matter what the objects
# @classmethod - it doesn't have access to self, but know what's class it's inside
# so bound to the class, and not the instance of the class


# sometimes we don't need many objects, and need only one
# so we can use Class as a container, for data and/or functionalty

# here the example how we would do it, but WITHOUT class method
import random

hat = Hat()
hat.sort("Harry")


# now let's do it the right way
# class variable - variable that exist in the class and there one copy for all objects
# we use it when we need to work with class, and not with objects

# so we don't need multiple hats, only one
# so, we use class as container to bundle functionality that connected to the hat

class Hat:

    houses = ["Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin"]

    @classmethod
    def sort(cls, name):  # cls - reference to the class

# we are not bothered creating object, we just access class method inside the class
